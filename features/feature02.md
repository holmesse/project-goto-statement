# Allow the inclusion of additional descriptive information on the program and each argument and provide named "-h" argument that shows usage and help information by default.

## Additional Information

Each argument has a meaning in the context of a given program. That meaning is what is conveyed in the descriptive information.

## Use Cases

Assume VolumeCalculator.java allows for three positional arguments, named `length`, `width`, and `height`, respectively.

    java VolumeCalculator -h

should produce the following output:

    usage: java VolumeCalculator length width height
    Calculate the volume of a box.
    positional arguments:
       length the length of the box
       width the width of the box
       height the height of the box
